Dash 'n Dive is the text message enabled Amazing Race inspired off-the-beaten-path dive crawl.

What the fuck does that mean?

Glad you asked.

Let me tell you about the user flow.

user goes to divendash.com 

they are told about the main outline of the experience. particulars are left out. what fun would that be. 

but we're going to let you in. 

here's the idea. you text our number

you have two teams. you put each teams team leader in. and the numbers of the other players

you select a date and time for game start

at game start people are texted the address of the first destination.

this first destination is different for each of the teams.

they are instructed to text that they are "here" upon arrival.

once texted unbeknownst to them they are asked to prove it.

There is a blue sign on the back wall, what does it say? they are asked

they reply budwiser.

you answer correct. you are awarded 1million points. 

simultaneously the other team is updated. "team butthole has arrived at their distination. hurry the fuck up."

after first team arrives and confirms via the location trivia they are given a bonus task to complete for 1million points. 

"get the bartender to say the word asshole without letting them know you are playing a game and trying to get them to say this word"

"done"

other person on team is texted and asked if you really did this.

"they did."

"1millions points," is the reply. 

other team is simultaneously texted, "team you suck now has 3million points. why are you fucking everything up?"

"everyone has 5 minutes to finish their drinks. next stop will be texted then"

"on next stop text when you finish your drink. first team to report all drinks drank get bonus. don't fuck this up!"
